# smart-routing

Creating a full-featured intelligent package delivery and route optimization system using machine learning and real-time traffic data is a complex task that usually involves several components. Here's a simplified version of such a project, broken down into smaller components. This example will cover data fetching, machine learning prediction, and error handling, giving you a foundation to build upon. Note that real-time data fetching and integration with traffic APIs would require actual API keys and configurations.

We'll use `scikit-learn` for machine learning, `requests` for fetching real-time data from a hypothetical API, and `pandas` for data handling. Please ensure to install these packages using `pip` if they're not installed yet.

    # You should replace this with actual API calls

### Key Points:
- **Data Fetching**: The `fetch_traffic_data` function simulates the fetching of traffic data. Replace it with actual API service calls.
- **Error Handling**: Each function has error handling to manage exceptions, whether they arise from network issues, data loading, or processing steps.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A basic Random Forest model is trained to predict delivery times based on features. Replace the model and features with what's relevant for your data set.
- **Comments**: Inline comments provide guidance on each step.

Ensure you have real-time traffic API access, replace placeholder API calls, and update the dataset with actual features and targets your project requires.
